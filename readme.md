# UAlbany Life

UAlbany Life is an uncompleted school project aimed at improving the quality of life for UAlbany students by providing useful information such as bus schedules, parking availability, and campus weather conditions. The project was initially intended to be a progressive web app.

## Project Overview

The main goals of the project were to:

- Display bus schedules for UAlbany transportation services.
- Provide real-time information on parking availability on campus.
- Show current weather conditions on the UAlbany campus.

## Project Status

As of now, the UAlbany Life project remains unfinished and is no longer being actively developed. The original plan was to host the project on AWS using Node.js, but the team later attempted to switch to PHP and deploy it on a private server. However, due to various challenges and constraints, the development process was halted.

## Technologies Used

- AWS (Amazon Web Services) for hosting the initial Node.js version.
- PHP for the attempted deployment on a private server.
- MySQL for the database to store project data.

## Contributions

While the project is no longer actively maintained, it is open-source, and contributions are welcome. If you would like to continue the development or use any part of the existing codebase for your own projects, feel free to fork the repository and work on it independently.
